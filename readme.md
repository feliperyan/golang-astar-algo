# Tips
Some stuff to keep in mind about GO

1. If I want functions to be viewed across files, like calling a function in utilities.go from within main.go, I have to "run" both of them.

2. Only stuff starting with capital letters is accessible in a package, there doesn't seem to be a public/private declaration.
